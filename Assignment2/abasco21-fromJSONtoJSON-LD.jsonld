Students will learn the methodological and technological foundations for the generation and publication of open data, with a special focus on how such data is often being structured and made available as knowledge graphs. The acquired knowledge will be also applicable for the management of knowledge graphs of private data, handled by private organisations. Special emphasis will be made on how such knowledge graphs can be used as data sources for data science activities, as well ahow data science is being used for knowledge graph management and curation purposes.",
