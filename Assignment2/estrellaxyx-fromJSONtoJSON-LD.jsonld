The course describes the foundations of artificial neural networks, which have been used with great success, for example, in problems related to perception or classification. Next, the course presents methods for building ontologies that are useful, for example, for symbolic knowledge representation and knowledge integration. Finally, the course explains natural language processing methods that are useful to facilitate a more effective human-machine interaction."

You will also learn about how to create shared agreed vocabularies and ontologies that can give support to Knowledge Graph generation and publication, and will understand how these principles and approaches have been applied to several domains. You will work on a practical hands-on exercise that will be the basis for your participation in hackatons and other similar events."
