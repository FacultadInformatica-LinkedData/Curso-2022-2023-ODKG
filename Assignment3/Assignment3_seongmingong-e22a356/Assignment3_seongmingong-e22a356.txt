1. Get all the properties that can be applied to instances of the Politician class (<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>)

--> PREFIX dbo:<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

    SELECT DISTINCT ?properties 
    WHERE {
    ?x rdf:type dbo:Politician .
    ?x ?properties ?v .
    }


2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

--> PREFIX dbo:<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
    
    SELECT DISTINCT ?properties 
    WHERE {
    ?x rdf:type dbo:Politician .
    ?x ?properties ?v .
    FILTER (?properties!=rdf:type)
    }
 

3. Which different values exist for the properties, except for rdf:type, applicable to the instances of Politician?

--> PREFIX dbo:<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
    
    SELECT DISTINCT ?v
    WHERE {
    ?x rdf:type dbo:Politician .
    ?x ?properties ?v 
    FILTER (?properties!=rdf:type)
    }

4. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, which different values do they take globally for all those instances?

--> SELECT DISTINCT ?properties ?v

     WHERE {
     ?x rdf:type dbo:Politician .
     ?x ?properties ?v .
     FILTER (?properties!=rdf:type)
     }

5. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, how many distinct values do they take globally for all those instances?

--> PREFIX dbo:<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

    SELECT DISTINCT ?properties COUNT(?v) as ?num
    WHERE {
    ?x rdf:type dbo:Politician .
    ?x ?properties ?v .
    FILTER (?properties!=rdf:type)
    }
    ORDER BY ?v
