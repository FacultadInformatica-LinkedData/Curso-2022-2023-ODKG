    Analysis
        - The resource naming strategy does not ensure uniqueness of individuals.
    Ontology
        - The ontology is not syntactically valid. Use ontology editors to avoid these problems.
        - The range is missing in one property.
    RDF data
        - The repository does not contain any RDF file with the transformed dataset.
