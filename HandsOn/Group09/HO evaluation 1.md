    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The resource naming strategy for individuals is not correct. The URI of a municipality should not depend on the URI of a cigar store, for example.
    Ontology
        - xsd:real does not exist.
        - You are creating classes for every value and that is not correct. For example, latitude and Longitude are not classes and are not subclass of location.
    RDF data
        - The related assignment has not been delivered.
