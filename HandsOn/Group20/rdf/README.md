
The current versions for the ontology and the mappings, as well as for the knowledge graphs, the sparql queries and the shacl analysis can be accesed in their correspondent folders. Older versions for all of these files (the ones corresponding with what we had prior to HOEvaluation1) have been stored in "previous-files" folders, created for that purpose.

"output-ntriples.nt",  "output-ntriples-with-links-assignment-5.nt", "output-turtle.ttl" and "output-turtle-with-links-assignment-5.ttl" corresponds with the knowledge graphs resulting for what we had to deliver for the 5th and previous assignments (the mappings before reusing other existing ontologies in our case) once we have taken into account H0Evaluation1's comments and fixed things according to that. 

"output-ntriples-with-links.nt" and "output-turtle-with-links.ttl" corresponds to the knowledge graph for the final assignment.
