The current versions for the ontology and the mappings, as well as for the knowledge graphs, the sparql queries and the shacl analysis can be accesed in their correspondent folders. Older versions for all of these files (the ones corresponding with what we had prior to HOEvaluation1) have been stored in "previous-files" folders, created for that purpose.

"shapes-assignment-5.nt" and "report-assignment-5.ttl" represents the shacl validation process applied to the knowledge graph corresponding to the assignment-5, once we have taken into account the comments on H0Evaluation1 to fix it. "shapes.nt" and "report.ttl" represents the shacl validation process applied to the knowledge graph corresponding to the final assignment.
