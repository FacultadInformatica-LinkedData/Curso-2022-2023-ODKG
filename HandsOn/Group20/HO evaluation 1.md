    Analysis
        - The resource naming strategy for instances belonging to a subClass must not be different to that of regular instances.
    Ontology
        - Some of the properties defined with numbers as ranges are not numbers.
        - Check if you need those classes for which you just define a datatype property. They should be directly datatype properties.
    RDF data
        - URLs are encoded as strings.
        - xsd:date values are not correctly represented.
        - float values are not properly encoded.
