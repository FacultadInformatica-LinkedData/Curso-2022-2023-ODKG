        - The ontology does not follow the resource naming strategy defined in the analysis.
        - xsd:String does not exist.
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
